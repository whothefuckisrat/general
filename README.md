# FAQ AND TL;DR

So you've clicked on my discussion link because you're curious about who I am; or you've clicked on this out of total curiosity and have no idea who I am or what I do.

Both of these options are totally acceptable.

Nevertheless, I'll provide you with some answers and hopefully this will allow you to develop an insight into me.

My name is Josh but online I've run with the alias 'rat' for a few years now.
This has had a few distinct variations over the years such as 'ratisgone', 'ratsgonedark', 'ratsgonedarkv2' and 'whothefuckisrat'
I gained the nickname 'rat' a few years ago as I was a huge fanatic of twitch in league of legends and one of my friends irl said I reminded them of a rat so the name just stuck.

I'm a big movie and game buff, though I wouldn't consider myself a connoisseur to any degree.

I like to review games and movies from time to time, some of which are on my steam group page which you were just on (most likely), and that I guess you would consider my passion.

I've always been a fan of First=person shooters though, in more recent years, I find myself straying more towards games that provide a unique experience rather than a traditional feeling.
What I mean by this is, I've in more recent years started playing indie and hidden gem titles such as 'My Lovely Daughter' or 'The Lost and the Wicked'.

As of right now here are some stats and tid-bits about me:

sincerely, whothefuckisrat
